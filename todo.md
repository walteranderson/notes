# Entities

- notes
- tasks
- links
- tags


## Notes

Main building block, can own tasks and links.
Basically just a giant markdown textarea for free-form notes.
Can have tags.

Possible uses:

- consolidating project notes and associated tasks/links
- brainstorming new ideas, keeping related tasks and links together for better context
- keeping track of recipes and links to where I found them (as well as notes on changes I've made)


## Tasks

Single item todos, can belong to a note or not.
Can have tags.


## Links

URLs with context, can belong to a note or not.
Can have tags.


## Tags

Everything can be tagged. Should be a simple mechanism to apply some context to an entity.
